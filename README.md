## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### Main Page

- **Sidebar with Search & Filters**:

  - Dynamic filtering by status, gender, species, etc;
  - Active filters shown with the ability to toggle or clear them;

- **Character Grid**:
  - Displays cards with name, image, status, and species;
  - Responsive grid layout with hover effects;
  - Pagination support;

### Filtering Logic

- Filters are synced with the URL via `searchParams`;
- Selecting a filter toggles its state (on/off);
- A "Clear Filters" button resets all filters instantly;
- Empty search results are gracefully handled with a "No results" message;

### Character Details Page

- Shows **complete character information**:
  - Name, image, status, species, gender, and more.
  - Origin and current location (with dimension and type).
- **Episode Appearance**:
  - If the character appears in **only one episode**:
    - Displays a single **"Seen In"** section with episode and location info.
  - If the character appears in **multiple episodes**:
    - Splits into **"First Seen"** and **"Last Seen"** sections.
    - The rest of the appearances are listed in an **"Other Episodes"** section.
- **Graceful fallback**:
  - If there are no additional episodes ‚Äî the "Other Episodes" section is hidden.
- **Error Handling**:
  - If an invalid character ID is accessed, the app redirects to a custom **404 Not Found** page.

### Data Handling

- **Server-Side Rendering** for main page (characters list);
- **GraphQL Fragments**:
  - Reused for both cards and detail pages to reduce duplication;
- **Strong Type Safety**:
  - Fully typed data via `graphql-codegen`;
- **Graceful Loading**:
  - Handles missing fields like image or location with fallbacks;
